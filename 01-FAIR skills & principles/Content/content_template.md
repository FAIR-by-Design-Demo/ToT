# FAIR Skills & Principles

To be able to successfully design FAIR learning objects an instructional designer must expand the traditional skill set with additional FAIR related skills. Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. 

Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

## FAIR-by-Design Instructional Design Skills

The skills required to start producing FAIR learning materials can be divided into two groups:
- FAIR oriented skills
    - Expertise in advocacy and promotion of the FAIR guiding principles
    - Expertise in curating and sharing FAIR data enabling
        - Efficient application of the concept of metadata
            - Choosing and implementing metadata schema with accompanying controlled vocabularies and ontologies
        - Understanding the concept of storing and indexing digital objects
            - Use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital objects
            - Use of repositories or learning management systems and storing platforms
    - Legal expertise to be able to recognize, define and combine 
        - Intellectual Property Rights
        - Licensing
        - Attribution and citing of learning materials and other resources
- Traditional instructional design oriented skills
    - Technical expertise in
        - Different tools and formats used for creation and delivery of learning content and their interoperability
        - Use of versioning during the creation and maintenance of different types of materials and resources
    - Good communication, collaboration and research skills that will support the process of 
        - Co-creation, 
        - Sharing, 
        - Finding and reuse of learning materials, and 
        - Implementation of best practices and other related policies
    - Learning experience design
        - Ensuring effective learning by using the [magic triangle of learning](https://cognota.com/blog/what-is-the-magic-triangle-aligning-learning-objectives-training-activities-and-assessment-methods/)
            - learning objectives
            - training activities
            - assessment methods

In 2016, the ‘[FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)’ were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.

A practical “how to” guidance to go FAIR can be found in the [Three-point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/).

**Findable**
The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the [FAIRification process](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/).

[F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f1-meta-data-assigned-globally-unique-persistent-identifiers/)

[F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)

[F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f3-metadata-clearly-explicitly-include-identifier-data-describe/)

[F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f4-metadata-registered-indexed-searchable-resource/)

**Accessible**
Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

[A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/542-2/)

- [A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-1-protocol-open-free-universally-implementable/)

- [A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-2-protocol-allows-authentication-authorisation-required/)

[A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available] (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a2-metadata-accessible-even-data-no-longer-available/)

**Interoperable**
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

[I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/)

[I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-follow-fair-principles/)

[I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-metadata/)

**Reusable**
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

[R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/)

- [R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/)

- [R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)

- [R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)

The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure. For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata and data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (the infrastructure component).
