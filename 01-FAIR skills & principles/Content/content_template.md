# FAIR Skills & Principles

To be able to successfully design FAIR learning objects an instructional designer must expand the traditional skill set with additional FAIR related skills. Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. 

Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

## FAIR-by-Design Instructional Design Skills

        - Efficient application of the concept of metadata
            - Choosing and implementing metadata schema with accompanying controlled vocabularies and ontologies
        - Understanding the concept of storing and indexing digital objects
            - Use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital objects

## FAIR guiding principles

The ‘[FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)’ are published in Scientific Data in 2016. The main goal of this work is to provide guidelines on how to improve the
- **F**indability, 
- **A**ccessibility, 
- **I**nteroperability, and 
- **R**eusability of digital objects. 

One of the main points is enabling FAIR not only from human, but also machine perspective, enabling automated actions on various digital objects.

As digital learning materials are a type of digital objects, the general FAIR principles can also be applied to them. Note that the FAIR principles refer to three entities: 
    - the digital object
    - the metadata (information that describes the digital object), and 
    - the infrastructure that stores or indexes the digital object (e.g. repository and catalogue). 

### Findable
To ensure a digital object is findable 
- the object should be accompanied with sufficiently detailed descriptive metadata
- a unique and persistent identifier (PID) such as a digital object identifier (DOI) should be used to point to the digital object.

### Accessible
For the digital object to be accessible
- the metadata and the object content should be understandable to both humans and machines, and 
- the digital object should be stored in a trusted repository.
- clear authentication and authorization procedures should be defined and outlined
- although the access to the digital object can be restricted, the access metadata should always be open

### Interoperable
The digital object is considered interoperable if
- the metadata should follow a commonly accepted metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies
- formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) should be used for the digital object representation

### Reusable
To be reusable a digital object should have
- a clear usage license 
- accurate information on provenance.


More information about the FAIR principles and the general FAIRification process can be found on the [GOFAIR website](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/).

## FAIR Learning Objects

When applying the FAIR guiding principles to learning materials there are several aspects that need to be considered.

### Perspective

Are the learning materials FAIR from a learner perspective or from the trainer/instructor perspective, or both? Using the FAIR-by-design methodology we aim to make the learning materials FAIR from both perspectives.

This means that we aim to make the learning materials FAIR for both learners and other trainers and instructional designers.

### Granularity

What is the level of granularity when applying the FAIR principles? Should the course be FAIR as a whole, or should each course module be FAIR on its own? 

The highest granularity level where we can apply the FAIR principles is the level of the learning object.

![Hierarchical representation of the granularity of different learning materials aggregations](./img/learning_content.jpg)

We define a **FAIR learning object** as any FAIR digital resource that supports learning developed around a single learning objective. At the very core of this approach is the idea that the learning object, accompanied with suitable descriptive metadata, can be used as a common building block for the development of more complex learning content by reusing it, re-purposing it, and potentially revising it.

The best practice is to define a learning object as a package of: 
- concrete learning outcome
- lesson plan
- lesson content 
- one or more activities
- assessment 
- facilitation guide. 

### Characteristics of FAIR learning objects

- **Findable** – the learning object is the lowest hierarchical level of findability of learning materials in the EOSC ecosystem and is thus the lowest hierarchical level that can be described with metadata and catalogued
- **Accessible** – the full scope (content, tools and implementation resources) of the learning object should be accessible to both learning producers and consumers in the EOSC ecosystem
- **Interoperable** – with a well-chosen scope (content, tools and implementation resources), the learning object can be consumed on multiple platforms
- **Re-usable** – each learning object can be put in a wider context based on the specific learning requirements of a particular aggregate course, unit or module in the EOSC ecosystem.

In summary:
- Learning objects are digital
- Learning objects contain learning content and information on tools and implementation resources
- Learning objects have an explicit learning objective
- Learning objects tend to be, but are not necessarily, small or granular in nature
- Learning objects tend to be, but are not necessarily, disassociated from context
- Learning objects are stored in a repository
- Learning objects are described using a metadata specification
- Learning objects are findable by searching a catalogue
- Learning objects are interoperable in that they can be used in multiple learning environments
- Learning objects are reusable by both other instructors and learners
- Learning objects can be repurposed for different learning contexts
- Learning object are composable into aggregates.
