# FAIR Skills & Principles

To be able to successfully design FAIR learning objects an instructional designer must expand the traditional skill set with additional FAIR related skills. Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. 

Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the FAIR-by-Design instructional design skills
- Summarize the FAIR guiding principles
- Compare licenses
- Write attribution
- Identify Permanent Identifiers (PIDs)
- Recognize metadata
- Interpret the instructional design process

## Target Audience
- attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar

## Duration
30 mins

## Prerequisites
none

## Learning Tools

- list any tools that are necessary to be used to complete the learning unit
- examples include required software, access to resources, etc.

## FAIR-by-Design Instructional Design Skills

The skills required to start producing FAIR learning materials include:
- Expertise in advocacy and promotion of the FAIR guiding principles
- Expertise in curating and sharing FAIR data enabling
    - Efficient application of the concept of metadata
        - Choosing and implementing metadata schema with accompanying controlled vocabularies and ontologies
    - Understanding the concept of storing and indexing digital objects
        - Use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital objects
        - Use of repositories or learning management systems and storing platforms
- Legal expertise to be able to recognize, define and combine 
    - Intellectual Property Rights
    - Licensing
    - Attribution and citing of learning materials and other resources
- Technical expertise in
    - Different tools and formats used for creation and delivery of learning content and their interoperability
    - Use of versioning during the creation and maintenance of different types of materials and resources
- Good communication, collaboration and research skills that will support the process of 
    - Co-creation, 
    - Sharing, 
    - Finding and reuse of learning materials, and 
    - Implementation of best practices and other related policies
- Instructional design and development expertise necessary for the creation of high-quality learning materials




Here goes the content of the learning unit divided into a number of subtopics and any additional headings as necessary.

Use blank rows to divide between paragraphs.

References to external or internal content provided elsewhere should be linked with [hyperlinks](https://pages.github.com/).

### Sub-subtitle

Refer to a different learning unit using a relative link. For an example, see the [README](README.md) file.

*Example italic text*

**Example bold text**

### Lists

Example numbered bullets:
1. numbered list one
2. two
3. three

Example unnumbered list.

- unnumbered list
- item two
- item three
    - subitem
    - use 4 spaces to create nested subitem

You can also create mixed lists.

- mixed list
    1. now numbered subitem
    2. subitem number two
- back to mixed list level 1 bullet

### Images

To add an image, first place the image in the /img folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front. 
All images should be located in the img folder that is on the same level with the content file.

Don't forget attribution if the image was not created by you. If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay).

### Accessibility

Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.

### Tables

Tables are a bit tricky in md, the easiest way to create them is to use a tool that will generate the md code that you can then just copy paste in your content file.
One such tool that can be used is the [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) available online. The provided example table has been generated using this tool. 

| **Column 1 title** | **Column 2 title**  |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| content 1          |      content 4      |
| content 2          |      content 5      |
| content 3          | content 6 content 7 |
