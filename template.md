## Learning content

Here goes the content of the learning unit divided into a number of subtitles and any additional headings as necessary.

Use blank rows to divide between paragraphs.

References should be linked with [hyperlinks](https://pages.github.com/).

### Sub-subtitle

Refer to a different learning unit using a relative link. For an example, see the [README](README.md) file.

*Italic text*

**Bold text**

Example numbered bullets:
1. numbered list one
2. two
3. three

Example unnumbered list.

- unnumbered list
- item two
- item three
    - subitem
    - use 4 spaces to create nested subitem

You can also create mixed lists.

- mixed list
    1. now numbered subitem
    2. subitem number two
- back to mixed list level 1 bullet




To add an image, first place the image in the /img folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front.
