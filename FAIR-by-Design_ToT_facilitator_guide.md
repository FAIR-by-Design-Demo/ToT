# FAIR-by-Design Training Facilitator Guide

The purpose of this document is to include all necessary information regarding the preparation and planning of the FAIR-by-Design Training of Trainers.
The training is organized as an online multi-day webinar using a Big Blue Button (BBB) room integrated into a Moodle based learning platform for course materials and interaction with trainees. 

## Training materials, resources and equipment
### Learning materials
The learning materials for the trainees should all be available on the learning platform before the beginning of the event, divided per learning sections. 
At the top of the course before the learning sections add:
- link to BBB room
- open forum
- feedback form
- training syllabus

Each learning section should have:
- Slides in PDF
- Learning Notes (HTML of learning unit contents)
- Activity links or documents (if any)
- Further reading links
- Self-assessment quiz

The trainers materials latest version is taken from the GitHub repo.

### Resources
- Menti prepared according to the activities
    - if Menti is not available, use internal BBB quiz by copy-pasting the questions
- BBB room added to the course on the learning platform
- MD editor of choice (VS code)
