## Unit Lesson Plan

an effective lesson plan for online trainees is not the same as for traditional students.

A lesson plan refers to a detailed step-by-step guide for a teacher to understand what materials to give to students and how to provide them so students would accomplish their learning goals during the course.

When working with learners in virtual classrooms, you also need to think about how you’ll hold their attention during a lesson and what tricks you’ll use to motivate them to visit your next class and finish the course.

Types:
- Detailed: a detailed plan includes what you will teach, presenting both the teacher planner and student activities.
- Semi-detailed: a semi-detailed plan is less complex and offers a general game plan of what you want to cover on a particular day or lesson.
- Understanding by design (UbD): this is more of a reversed engineering model, as it focuses on evaluating the outcomes before creating curriculum units for students.

With unit planning, you list all lesson objectives along with a projected time frame of completion. Each unit offers certain activities and learning experiences using many types of learning that make up a systematic method of instruction on a subject matter (e.g., social studies, physical science, and so on).

Although unit lesson plans tend to follow a systematic approach, there is some flexibility in what is covered each day. As such, it falls in the semi-detailed lesson plan structure.

### Hunter Model
1. Set the learning objectives
    - A learning objective is what you want students to learn by the end of the class. Ensure these are clear and follow a logical order that is easy to understand and helps students identify meaningful concepts and ideas.
2. Identify the needs of the target audience
    - make sure you are prepared to help learners along the way
3. Plan your training material
    - creating a list of all the resources. From stationary like a pen or paper to technology equipment like laptops, software, or gamified learning tools like apps or any educational website, all these can help you get the most out of what you intend to do.
4. Present the outline of the lesson - the Hook
    - Throughout the lesson, your goal is to keep students engaged. An outline can help them develop a context around the subject you are teaching, letting them know what is coming next, and encourage them to relate to the learning materials at hand. Don’t forget to draw relevant examples of events or develop creative activities that spark interest and attention.
5. Instruct the lesson
    - follow the order and present the resources you need, but also make sure to involve students in this process. You may use as much multimedia as you want to facilitate engagement and give a wealth of examples students can relate to easily – from simple PowerPoint Slides to exciting graphics on a computer. What’s important here is presenting information in a meaningful way.
6. Give students time to practice
    - Once you finish your instruction, it’s the students’ turn to take the lead. Ask them to show what they have learned through practice. For an example start with a guided practice – allowing students to make sense of the information they have just received, then follow with the collaborative process – let students work in groups to explore main concepts and finish with independent practice – giving each student time to work on their own through an assignment.
7. Wrap-up
    - do an overview of what has been discussed and what students have learned. Ask them to tell you the key takeaways of the lesson, identifying main ideas and conclusions. Assign homework duties and give them a preview of the next lesson to prepare them.
8. Evaluate
    - determine whether the learning objectives have been met, and ensure that students understood what you taught through a small quiz, test, or exam.
9. Reflection
    - did everything do as planned or something needs to be improved?
