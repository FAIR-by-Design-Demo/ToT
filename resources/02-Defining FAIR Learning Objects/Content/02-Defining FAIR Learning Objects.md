# FAIR Skills & Principles

To be able to successfully design FAIR learning objects an instructional designer must expand the traditional skill set with additional FAIR related skills. Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. 

Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the FAIR-by-Design instructional design skills
- Summarize the FAIR guiding principles
- Define FAIR learning objects

- Recognize metadata
- Identify Permanent Identifiers (PIDs)
- Compare licenses
- Write attribution
- Interpret the instructional design process

## Target Audience
- attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar

## Duration
30 mins

## Prerequisites
none

## Learning Tools

- list any tools that are necessary to be used to complete the learning unit
- examples include required software, access to resources, etc.

## Metadata and Metadata Schema



### RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources

The RDA Education And Training On Handling Of Research Data Interest Group has defined a minimal metadata seta for learning resources that has become a de facto standard for describing FAIR learning materials.

The following table describes the minimal metadata set elements and their definitions:

| **Element Name** | **Definition** |
|---|---|
| Title | The human readable name of the resource. |
| Abstract / Description | A brief synopsis about or description of the learning resource |
| Author(s) | Name of entity(ies) authoring the resource |
| Primary Language | Language in which the resource was originally published or made available |
| Keyword(s) | Keywords or tags used to describe the resource |
| License | A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL |
| Version Date | Version date for the most recently published or broadcast resource |
| URL to Resource | URL that resolves to the learning resource or to a "landing page" for the resource that contains important contextual information  including the direct resolvable link to the resource, if applicable. |
| Resource URL Type | Designation of the identifier scheme  used for the resource URL, e.g., DOI, ARK, Handle |
| Target Group (Audience) | Principal users(s) for which the resource was designed |
| Learning Resource Type | The predominant type or kind that characterizes the learning resource |
| Learning Outcome | Descriptions of what knowledge, skills or abilities a learner should acquire on completion of the resource |
| Access Cost | Choice stating whether or not there is a fee for use of the resource (yes, no, maybe) |
| Expertise (Skill) Level | Target skill level in the topic being taught; example values include beginner, intermediate, advanced |
