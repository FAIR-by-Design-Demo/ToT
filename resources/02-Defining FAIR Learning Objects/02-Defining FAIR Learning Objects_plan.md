# Defining FAIR Learning Objects

The purpose of this learning unit is to introduce all relevant FAIR concepts that are necessary when developing learning objects such as metadata, PIDs, repo, licenses, attribution, etc. Once these concepts are adopted, the instructional designer is then ready to start with the backwards instructional process by defining the main aspects of the learning materials such as learning objects.

### Location
