	### Content templates

We have developed a few templates that should help you incorporate the essential information in each learning unit in a consistent structured way.

The [learning unit content template](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates/blob/main/resources/Training%20Unit/template_content.md) allows you to define the learners notebook with the main learning content that you are aiming to introduce the learners to. In the later stages you will see how this template ensures that the content will become part of a larger GitBook that will contain all learning content in a structured way. At this moment we will only focus on its main content.

The content of each learning unit should include:

- brief introduction
- learning objectives
- target audience
- duration
- prerequisites
- learning tools
- content
- summary
- suggested reading

Although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. 

The template supports adding different types of media to the content, which will be then added to the final HTML view making it a perfect vehicle for an integrated multi-modal approach.

For pure self-based learning the content template is enough to present all of the learning content in one place.

However, for trainer led environments, usually a slide deck is also necessary so that the trainer can lead the trainees across the learning content and work with them through the activities. For these purposes we have also added a [slide deck template](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates/blob/main/resources/Training%20Unit/Learning_unit_content.pptx) that outlines the necessary information that needs to be presented to the trainees.
