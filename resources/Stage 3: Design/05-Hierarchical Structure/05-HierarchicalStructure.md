# Hierarchical structure

Once the higher level outline is defined in the syllabus it is time to flesh out the rest while applying the same approach and concepts only on lower aggregation levels. You want to end up with a hierarchical structure that will define the lowest level elements (learning objects) of your learning materials as depicted in the image below.

Typically syllabus is defined on the level of a course (whole training) and depending on the size of the training it outlines the sections and/or modules in the syllabus instructional sequence.

It is recommended to go down to the level of a unit, where a unit will have no more than 4 learning objectives. As discussed previously best reuse is achieved if you manage to break down the unit into single learning objects around each specific learning objectives, however take into account that this process is extremely time consuming.

Note that you don't need to strictly follow the represented breakdown, for an example you can skip the sections and work with modules and units only.

**Flexibility is key!** Learning materials broken down into flexible self-contained learning units can more easily be reused by fitting them and adapting them in other learning structures.

### Activity

Try to develop your own hierarchical structure for the Open Science for Policy Makers course. Use the information you gathered in the Discovery step as inspiration keeping in mind its potential for reuse.

Mark the learning objects or learning units that you can reuse from what you have already discovered.
