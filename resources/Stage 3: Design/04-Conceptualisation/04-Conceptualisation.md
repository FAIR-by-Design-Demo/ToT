# Conceptualisation

Once the discovery stage is completed, the third step of the backward instructional process is activated. In this step the instructional designer needs to define the content concept map of the learning materials defining the sections, modules, units and learning objects it is going to contain. When the learning materials syllabus is defined in this way, the design continues by creating a blueprint of the organisation of the learning materials, including additional documents that serve as an instructor facilitator kit promoting reuse by enabling others fully understand the learning content and its delivery.

## Learning Objectives
- Preparing a syllabus
- Structuring the learning materials
- Defining content based on templates

## Target Audience
- attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar

## Duration
45 mins

## Prerequisites
none

## Learning Tools
- Training BBB room
- Browser
- Menti access or BBB quiz interaction

## Content concept map

Concept mapping is a tool for visualising interrelationships between concepts in an integrated, hierarchical manner. Using concept maps helps clarify the relationships among learning concepts when designing or redesigning your learning materials. The main goal of the concept map is to start outlining the specific components of your training, organize the components and make sure that they fit in with the defined learning objectives.

It does not matter which type of concept map you will use (hierarchical, spider, flowchart, etc.), the main focus here is to flesh out the components that you would like to include in your materials. 

An example concept map for Open Science is presented in the image below.

Once you have identified your learning concepts, the next step is to sequence them into an instructional sequence (agenda). This instructional sequence will become your blueprint for the organisation of the learning materials and the definition of the syllabus.

In essence the blueprint takes the input from the creative concept map and organizes it into a more formal outline. Formally, we call this learning materials outline syllabus. Each syllabus should provide information regarding a number of elements (including the ones defined in the step 1 of the backward instructional design):

- clear, descriptive title 
- description of the purpose or goal 
- target audience
- prerequisites
- duration
- learning objectives
- agenda (instructional sequence)
- resources and materials
- certification information

Remember that:

- The syllabus can present a higher level sequence outline, that can be later broken down into smaller subtopics if necessary.
- The topics sequence should be defined so that the concepts introduced early help with the ones encountered later. 
- The defined agenda should not be very rigid thus preventing changing the sequence of topics or adding or deleting topics at a later stage.
- The syllabus is sent to the learners and should provide them with all necessary information to help them decide if they want to follow the training related to the learning materials.

### Syllabus Template

Within this training we provide a template for developing a training syllabus that contains all elements discussed so far:

- essential syllabus information
- additional information related to the RDA minimal metadata schema

The [syllabus template](https://github.com/FAIR-by-Design-Methodology/templates/blob/main/resources/syllabus.md) is part of the whole Templates package developed for your use. You can access this specific document using the link, however take into account that in the next stage of the training you will be given a detailed guide on how to obtain and use all developed templates. 

As syllabus is one of the required documents for the FAIR-by-Design learning materials, you must ensure that your syllabus has been developed based on this template, i.e. contains all elements provided in the template.

#### Activity

Review the [FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Training of Trainers](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/) syllabus that has been developed based on the provided template as a complete example.

Try to develop your own syllabus for the Open Science for policy makers training. Use the information you gathered and defined in the previous activities.

### Hierarchical structure

Once the higher level outline is defined in the syllabus it is time to flesh out the rest while applying the same approach and concepts only on lower aggregation levels. You want to end up with a hierarchical structure that will define the lowest level elements (learning objects) of your learning materials as depicted in the image below.

![Hierarchical learning content structure](./attachments/learning_content.jpg)

Typically syllabus is defined on the level of a course (whole training) and depending on the size of the training it outlines the sections and/or modules in the syllabus instructional sequence.

It is recommended to go down to the level of a unit, where a unit will have no more than 4 learning objectives. As discussed previously best reuse is achieved if you manage to break down the unit into single learning objects around each specific learning objectives, however take into account that this process is extremely time consuming.

Note that you don't need to strictly follow the represented breakdown, for an example you can skip the sections and work with modules and units only.

**Flexibility is key!** Learning materials broken down into flexible self-contained learning units can more easily be reused by fitting them and adapting them in other learning structures.

## Rich learning experience 

Effective learning experience is crucial for application of the obtained knowledge and skills in real world context. To achieve this end, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. 

Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. 

Rich learning experiences can be supported by 

- inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks
- thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction
- opportunities to practice and apply learning

It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback.

Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners.
