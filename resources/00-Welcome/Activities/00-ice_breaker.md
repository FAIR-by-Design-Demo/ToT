# Ice Breaker

Very simple activity that helps setup people for interaction and eases people into the training.

## Activity duration

5 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with

any number of people

## Goal of activity

Main purpose is to overcome the remote environment, create personal connection and diffuse anxiety and boredom.
Secondary purpose is to test out the tool for interaction (BBB quiz questions and Menti).

## Materials
- Menti slides
- Share screen
- Chat

## Instructions

Use just one simple question that can be adapted to time of day or other circumstances.

Create a Menti presentation:
- Menti slide with how to connect
- Menti slide with chosen question

During the training the moderator shares screen with the Menti presentation. Moderator should also provide the link to Menti in chat.

Example questions:
- Are you an early bird or night owl?
- Coffee or tea?
- Teleportation or flying?
- Are you a cat person or a dog person?
- Popcorn or M&Ms?

## Tips and Tricks
- can be done both physically and online
If you have more time you can use a more open ended question. This really helps for team building helping people to get to know each other.
