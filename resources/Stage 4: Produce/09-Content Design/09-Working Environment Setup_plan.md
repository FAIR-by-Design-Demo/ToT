# Working Environment Setup

The purpose of this learning unit is to introduce relevant tools and file formats required for developing FAIR-by-Design learning objects. Once a working environment consisting of the recommended tools is in place and the initial concepts regarding the underlying file formats have been adopted, the instructional designer is then ready to start with production of the learning objects themvselves.

### Location

- Online
- BBB course room

### Total duration

60 mins

### Number of attendees

- any (< 100)

### Learning objectives

- Use a version management system for versioning file contents
- Recognize and use open file formats for producing FAIR learning objects
- Use freely accessible software tools for working with the file formats
- Setup an automated publishing workflow for processing any changes made to the learning materials
- Evaluate the accessibility of learning objects
- Categorizing learning repositories
- Write reusable self-assessment quizes
- Perform quality assurance check
