# Existing Learning Materials

 The purpose of this learning unit is to continue with the instructional design process by analyzing existing learning materials and assessment methods that can help achieve the identified learning objectives. For these purposes the unit focuses on sources of existing learning materials that can be reused, focusing on the needs of the trainings that are to be done within the Skills4EOSC project.

## Learning Objectives
- Collect existing learning materials
- Compare learning materials repositories
- Discover learning materials catalogues

## Target Audience
- attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar

## Duration
60 mins

## Prerequisites
Completed [Stage 1: Prepare](../../Stage%201:%20Prepare/)

## Learning Tools
- Training BBB room
- Browser
- Menti access or BBB quiz interaction

## Instructional Design Process

Upon defining the learning objectives, the backward instructional design process focuses on thinking how assessment can be carried out in order to ascertain that the learning objectives have been reached and the new knowledge and skills have been obtained. This exercise helps the designer understand what type and content of learning material would be best suited to achieving the learning objectives. 

Searching for readily available learning materials helps get inspired with the different ways of assessment and related learning materials. It boosts the process of instructional design that does not have to start from scratch but can reuse materials for achieving some of the identified learning objectives.

As licenses determine the possibility of reuse, upon discovery of existing learning resources license identification must be carried out to ensure that the resource can be reused with attribution under the specified rules. Closed learning resource that do not allow reuse can be used only for inspiration and limited quoting and citation for illustrative purposes.

## Learning materials repositories

### OER Repositories

Identifying Open Educational Resources (OER) for reuse is always the best option as they are developed with reuse in mind. OER learning resources are stored in OER repositories. 

There are many OER repositories available, however their potential for reusing learning materials for the purposes of designing Open Science related courses is still very limited due to a number of reasons:

- most of the OER repositories are hosted by USA institutions
- most of the OER repositories store learning resources that are not related to Open Science
- there is no one search engine that searches through all available OER repositories

This is a short list of some of the most popular OER repositories and catalogues at the moment with a link to the repository and a short description:
- [DOAB (Directory of Open Access Books)](https://directory.doabooks.org/) -  a discovery service for peer reviewed open access books and book publishers that indexes and provides access to high quality, open access, peer-reviewed books.
- [MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resources for Learning and Online Teaching)](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm) - a free and open online community of resources designed primarily for faculty, staff and students of higher education from around the world to share their learning materials and pedagogy. The MERLOT system provides access to curated online learning and support materials and content creation tools, led by an international community of educators, learners and researchers.
- [OASIS (Openly Available Sources Integrated Search)](https://oasis.geneseo.edu/index.php) - a search tool that aims to make the discovery of open content easier
- [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/) - a public digital library of open educational resources. Explore, create, and collaborate with educators around the world to improve curriculum.
- [OERTX](https://oertx.highered.texas.gov/) - a public digital library of open educational resources for higher education. Search collections or create and collaborate to improve instruction.
- [Community of Online Research Assignments (CORA)](https://www.projectcora.org/) - Website with many assignments on many different topics including necessary materials to do each assignment
- [GALILEO Open Learning Materials](https://oer.galileo.usg.edu/) - administrated by Affordable Learning Georgia, an initiative of GALILEO and the University System of Georgia which aims to reduce the cost of textbooks to students and contribute to their retention, progression, and graduation.
- [FORRT (Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training)](https://forrt.org/) - provides a pedagogical infrastructure & didactic resources designed to recognize and support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible science offering FAIR teaching and mentoring resources

## Open multimedia

If you are planning to reuse multimedia in your learning materials (especially if using presentations) then the University Library Groningen offers an [extensive list of open multimedia](https://libguides.rug.nl/OER/OpenMultimediaResources) websites and services that should help you find multimedia with permissable licenses for reuse.

Another option is to use the images search in the Google engine together with the Tools -> Usage Rights -> Creative Commons Licenses.
