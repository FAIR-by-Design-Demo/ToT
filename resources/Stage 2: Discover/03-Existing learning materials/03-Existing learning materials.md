# Existing Learning Materials

To be able to successfully design FAIR learning objects an instructional designer must expand the traditional skill set with additional FAIR related skills. Using these newly acquired skills, the instructor can then incorporate additional actions in the backward instructional design process in order to produce FAIR-by-design learning objects. 

Thus, becoming familiar with the FAIR principles and their implementation is an essential step in the Prepare stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology. For the purposes of instructional design, the FAIR principles are applied to FAIR learning objects that represent the main digital objects used in learning/training activities.
