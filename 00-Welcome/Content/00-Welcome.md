# Welcome

## Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the FAIR-by-design methodology
- Identify FAIR design challenges

## Target Audience
- attendees of the FAIR-by-Design ToT live webinar

## Duration
- 10 mins

## Prerequisites
- familiarity with the published D2.2 FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials Methodology

## Learning Tools
- training BBB room
- Menti

## Participants

The training is focused on all Skills4EOSC project members that will need to develop learning materials for the different types of trainings envisaged within the project. No previous knowledge of FAIR materials development is required to follow the training. 
The training will be delivered by a set of trainers each focusing on different aspects of the FAIR-by-design methodology for development of FAIR learning materials. In addition, there will be moderators to help out with the technical aspects and fascilitators for any group activities. 

## Housekeeping

Participants can jump in during the training with a comment or question at any time using the provided chat or by opening their mics. Sharing personal experiences and recommending other tools and resources in addition to the examples provided during the training is strongly encouraged.
The focus of the training is on hands-on practical implementation of the FAIR-by-design methodology.
Thus there will be many activities that the participants will need to take active role in, aiming to test out the concepts and get a first hand experience.
There will be short 15 mins coffee breaks after each hour-hour and a half of traininig. During the second full day of training, there will be an 1 hour break for lunch.
Your feedback on this training is essential to improve it and provide you with additional examples and resources you might need during the FAIR learning materials development. Focusing on the co-creation process, in additon to the feedback form that is available on the course, there are many other ways to provide your feedback that will be presented during the training.

### Main interaction

The main interaction with the participants will be via mics, chat, BBB quiz and Menti questions.

## Training purpose

The main goal of the training is the practical implementation of the FAIR-by-Design learning materials methodology that has been developed by T2.3 and published in D2.2.
The methodology extends the backward instructional design process with the FAIR principles aiming to ensure that the learning materials will be findable, accessible, interoperable and resusable from their conception and throughout their lifetime including updates, new versions, reuse, etc.

The methodology is composed of 6 main steps that are iteratively repeated within a continous improvement loop:
- Prepare
- Discover
- Design
- Produce
- Publish
- Verify
